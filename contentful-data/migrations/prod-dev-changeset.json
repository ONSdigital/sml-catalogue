            "en-US": "Mean of Ratios imputation is a standard imputation method for business surveys. It can be used to impute value for unit (complete) non-response or item (partial) non-response. There is an option to use trimming as the method can be influenced by extreme values. The method imputes a single numeric variable. It uses the relationship between the variable being imputed and an appropriate predictive or auxiliary variable.\n\nAs imputation can be carried out for multiple periods simultaneously, the method can apply forward, backward or construction imputation. The type of imputation used will vary for each non-respondent in each period depending on whether data is available in the predictive period."

            "en-US": "Cell-key Perturbation adds small amounts of noise to frequency tables, to protect against disclosure. Noise is added to change the counts that appear in the frequency table by small amounts, for example a 14 is changed to a 15. This noise introduces uncertainty in the counts and makes it harder to identify individuals, especially when taking the ‘difference’ between two similar tables. An input file called a ‘ptable’ is needed which specifies the level of perturbation. These can also be used to apply rounding, and a threshold for small counts."

The primary use of the method is to automatically detect and correct errors in respondent data where fixed relationships have not been satisfied to improve the efficiency of the editing process, reduce the burden on respondents and survey validators and improve overall data quality. This method can also be used to ensure fixed relationships between variables are satisfied in other data types such as imputed data to improve overall data quality."

The automatic correction is applied to all relevant variables for the respondent."

The library ensures that methods for official statistical outputs are fully transparent. It provides proportionate governance and assurance processes, including peer review of methods for statistical production and analysis or exploration.\n\nThe library facilitates continuous improvement by providing users with the ability to add new methods or request changes to existing ones. It contains documentation on method specifications, how-to guidance and contact details for help and support. The SML will allow users to share methods and best practice with other government departments.\n\n## Current objectives\n\n- To act as a shared single point of reference for best practice methods and share methods across government departments.\n- To continuously update methods based on peer reviews, emerging facts and user feedback.\n- To provide clear evidence of audit and quality assurance for approved methods.\n\n## Future objectives\n- To standardise best practice methods across the ONS and government departments.\n- To act as a developmental tool, providing reference material and guides to approved methods.\n- To demonstrate, share and promote innovation in methodological practice across GSS/wider government.\n\n## Further information\nThe SML contains many features, including:\n\n- A catalogue of methods\n- Statistical methods specifications\n- A code repository\n- Downloadable Methods packages\n- Technical methods governance\n- A glossary of terms\n- How-to guidance"

            "en-US": "In business surveys, some responses can be very large, and can distort estimates when such a business is selected. Consequently, it is sometimes desirable to reduce the effect of these businesses. This is known as outlier treatment. This SML method applies a technique known as one-sided winsorisation. The objective of the method is to introduce a small bias, while reducing the variance. This is intended to reduce the mean squared error of the total, a measure of overall accuracy. The method works for stratified expansion estimation and combined ratio estimation, which are commonly used in business surveys."

Providing a resource to help fix these issues as they occur in the future.  \n\n#### Issues accessing a method on GitHub:  \nWhen following the links to the projects stored on GitHub you may receive a 404 error. Please ensure you are logged into\nGitHub.  \n\n#### Pip install issues:  \n\nPlease note all commands in this section should be run in either a terminal(Linux/Mac) or a command prompt(Windows).  \n\nIf you get an error when running pip install and can't immediately see the error try to add the --verbose flag to the\ncommand to see if that offers any more useful information, this can be done by running the command like so:  \n\"pip install {package} --verbose\"  \n\nIf multiple versions of python are installed on your machine it may also be the case that you need to run the command as\nsuch:  \n\"pip3 install {package}\"  \n\nSome other common errors include:  \n\n1. Package name is incorrect, double check that the file path and name that you are giving to the command is correct.\n2. If you have an outdated version of pip this can occasionally cause an issue, try running the below commands:  \n\"python -m pip install --update pip\"  \n\"python -m pip install --update wheel distutils\"  \n3. Permission errors, options here include running as admin/sudo where allowed or run:  \n\"pip install {package} --user\"  \nThis will run pip install defaulting the install location to the users home directory, as opposed to a system directory\nlike it normally would.\n4. Failure during install, on Windows in particular a library can have issues installing due to packages it relies on,\ntry running:  \n\"pip install {package} --prefer-binary\"  \nThis will cause pip to try install binary packages where possible as windows can sometimes throw errors compiling from\nsource\n\n#### Alternatives to pip for installation:  \n\nSome users may be in the scenario that due to user privileges that they are not allowed to use pip on their machines.\nAs an alternative to the .whl file, within a given release there will also be a tar.gz file in the format of\n{LibraryName-version.tar.gz}. Download this file and extract it:  \n\n- On a Unix system (linux/OSX) run the following command in a terminal: \"tar -xf archive.tar.gz\". Substituting archive.tar.gz\nwith the path to the tar.gz file downloaded\n\n- On a Windows system open the file within 7Zip or a similar file archive program and follow the interface to extract the\nfolder.  \n\nNavigate to the extracted folder within a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:    \n\"python setup.py install\".  \n\nOnce this completes the library should now be installed on your machine. Please note on the above command to ensure\nthat you use the correct python command. Particularly for unix users, python V3.0 and higher will often be run as python3\nwithin the terminal. If the previous command failed, it may be that you need to instead substitute it with: \n\"python3 setup.py install\".  \nAlternatively on Windows machine python may sometimes be installed as py so:  \n\"py setup.py install\"."

Due to its robust nature, it does not use any form of trimming or outliering.\n\nAs imputation can be carried out for multiple periods simultaneously, the method can apply forward, backward or construction imputation.

            "en-US": "Sampling in business surveys is often done using stratified simple random sampling without replacement. The largest businesses are usually selected with certainty. This SML method uses two approaches for estimating totals in such cases. The Horvitz-Thompson estimator in this case is known as a stratified expansion estimator, which is the simplest method used. We also use a combined ratio estimator. This is appropriate where there is a linear relationship through the origin between the target variable and an auxiliary variable we know for all units, and the scatter about the line increases with the size of the auxiliary variable."
