#### How to request for a method to be developed

If you would like a new method to be developed and added to the Statistical Methods Library, you will need to submit a Method Request for a new method. See help section 1.7 for details on how to do this. Please be aware that users outside of the ONS will be required to dedicate their own technical resource for method coding.

#### How to change an existing method

Methods developed by the ONS Digital Services Team can be changed to include additional functionality by raising a Method Request. Please see help section 1.7 for details on how to request this.

#### How to add existing code to the SML

If a code or piece of software relating to a method is developed and maintained outside of ONS, this can be added to the SML by submitting a Method Request for a third-party method.  This may include packages that are developed within ONS but where code is held and managed in a separate repository, or packages that have been developed and maintained externally.

If you would like to directly contribute code to be stored on the SML GitHub repository, you can submit a Method Request for a new method and state that it is a community method and the code is already written. Please see help section 1.7 for details on submitting method requests.
