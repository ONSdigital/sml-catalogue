Method requests can be raised to:

* Have new methods developed for the Statistical Methods Library.
* Add existing code to the Statistical Methods Library.
* Change existing methods held within the Statistical Methods Library.

Method requests can be submitted to the ONS Statistical Methods Library via the IBM Business Automation Workflow (BAW). The BAW is used across the ONS for a variety of purposes, so you may have access to this tool already.

If you do not have access to the IBM Business Automation Workflow (BAW):

1. You can gain access to the BAW via ServiceNow in “I Want Something > 04 – Software, Applications & Platforms > Automation Requests”.
2. Fill in the fields as follows:
    1. Please choose an activity: “Access – add, change or remove”
    2. Please select Access Type: “New Access”
    3. Please select the Service: “BAW”
    4. Select the Solution this request relates to: “STATISTICAL METHODS LIBRARY”
    5. Who is this request for: enter your name and the name of each other user you are requesting access for
3. Click on the BAW spreadsheet link.
4. Enter your details and the details of each user you are requesting access for
5. Under “Environment(s) required”, enter ‘a’ under Production. Leave each other column blank
6. Under ‘Application Group Names’ add ‘SML_REQUESTORS_PROD’ in place of ‘DAO Requestor’ and put ‘a’ in this column
7. Save and attach this spreadsheet to the ServiceNow request and submit your request (filling out other mandatory fields as appropriate)

If you already have access to the BAW, and want access to the SML forms, the same instructions above apply.

Once you have been granted access to the SML forms on the BAW, login to the BAW here: [https://www.bpm.ibmcloud.com/auth/index.jsp(opens](https://www.bpm.ibmcloud.com/auth/index.jsp).

Click on “Process Portal”. In the left-hand menu you will see “Create SML Method Request” - if you cannot see a menu on the left-hand side of the screen, click the three horizontal lines at the top left corner of the screen.

Click on "Create SML Method Request”, and fill out the information in this form to create the desired request.

Once you have filled out the form, you will need to complete a method specification. Please use the following [template](https://officenationalstatistics.sharepoint.com/sites/MTHIT/SysDev/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FMTHIT%2FSysDev%2FStatistical%5FMethods%5FLibrary%2FCommunication%2FSML%20methodological%20specification%20template%2Emd&parent=%2Fsites%2FMTHIT%2FSysDev%2FStatistical%5FMethods%5FLibrary%2FCommunication&p=true&ga=1) to help you do this.

#### I am a user from outside the ONS

Currently we do not accept formal method submissions or change requests from external users. In future, we will accept certain method requests via the Integrated Data Service [https://integrateddataservice.gov.uk/](https://integrateddataservice.gov.uk/). If you would like to make a suggestion for a new method, or to provide feedback about an existing method, please do so by emailing [smlhelp@ons.gov.uk](smlhelp@ons.gov.uk).
