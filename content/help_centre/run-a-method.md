1. Go to the GitHub repository page (linked to from method's details page in the catalogue), and click on "Releases". Find the release you want, noting any warnings or information about that version.
Release pages for both repositories can be found below:  
[https://github.com/ONSdigital/sml-python-small/releases](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sml-python-small/releases)
[https://github.com/ONSdigital/statistical-methods-library/releases](https://github.com/ONSdigital/statistical-methods-library/releases)
2. Download the `.whl` (wheel) file of the release that you wish to install.
3. On the command line run `pip install PATH_TO/some-file.whl` where that path represents the location on your computer that you downloaded the file.
4. You should now have the method available to import into your python code.

Specific instructions on using the method will be found within the git repository for that method.
