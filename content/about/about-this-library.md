# About the Statistical Methods Library
## What is the Statistical Methods Library?

The statistical methods library is a central library for approved statistical methods for use within ONS and wider.

## Overall mission

The Statistical Methods Library (SML) provides a central resource for consistent and reproducible statistical methods within the ONS and wider. The library ensures that methods for official statistical outputs are fully transparent. It provides proportionate governance and assurance processes, including peer review of methods for statistical production and analysis or exploration.

The library facilitates continuous improvement by providing users with the ability to add new methods or request changes to existing ones. It contains documentation on method specifications, how-to guidance and contact details for help and support. The SML will allow users to share methods and best practice with other government departments.

## Current objectives

* To act as a shared single point of reference for best practice methods and share methods across government departments.
* To continuously update methods based on peer reviews, emerging facts and user feedback.
* To provide clear evidence of audit and quality assurance for approved methods.

## Future objectives

* To standardise best practice methods across the ONS and government departments.
* To act as a developmental tool, providing reference material and guides to approved methods.
* To demonstrate, share and promote innovation in methodological practice across GSS/wider government.
