  "meaning": "A popular scheme for determining version numbers. Consists of three integers, separated by full stops. The first integer is the 'major' version number, the second is the 'minor' version number, and the third is the 'patch' number. The patch number is incremented by 1 when bugfixes are implemented. The minor version is incremented by 1 when new functionality is introduced without affecting compatibility with previous versions. The major version number is incremented by 1 when changes are made that break compatibility with previous versions. See https://semver.org"
