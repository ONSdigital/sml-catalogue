  meaning: |||
    A popular software tool for version control.  Files are stored in repositories (or "repos"), which can be local or remote, and changes made are committed to a log, allowing files to be reverted to previous versions.  A project can have multiple contributing authors and multiple 'branches' (variants) simultaneously, with Git providing tools to merge changes.
