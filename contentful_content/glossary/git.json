{"term": "Git", "meaning": "A popular software tool for version control. Files are stored in repositories (or 'repos'), which can be local or remote, and changes made are committed to a log, allowing files to be reverted to previous versions. A project can have multiple contributing authors and multiple 'branches' (variants) simultaneously, with Git providing tools to merge changes."}
