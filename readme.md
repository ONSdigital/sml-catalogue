# SML Portal

This repo contains the build environment and code to generate and upload the Statistical Methods Library (SML) Portal website.

## Build and deploy

### S3 Bucket creation

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro) is used to deploy the S3 Bucket where the website is hosted. The S3 bucket will be suffixed with the currently checked-out gt branch name.

Fetch your AWS credentials and export them to the terminal. Then:

```shell
./terraform.sh apply
```

This command will output the URL for your new site, and will have the form `https://xxxxxxx.cloudfront.net/`.

### Fetch ONS Design System

Download the release of the ONS Design System, and unpack them into the correct location with this command:

```shell
./get_design_system.sh
```

### Make the site

You will first need to install the python dependencies, including [Frozen-flask](https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/), the static website generator:

```shell
pipenv sync
```

With [Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/learning/getting_started.html) content in the `content/` directory, you should now be able to run the Flask demo server:

```shell
pipenv run flask --app sml_builder --debug run
```

If this all goes well with no errors, you should now be able to navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) to view the site. And if that all looks good, you can now "freeze" the site, rendering it to HTML with:

```shell
pipenv run python freeze.py
```

And finally, upload to the S3 bucket (assuming you still have valid AWS credentials exported to the terminal):

```shell
aws s3 sync build s3://sml-portal-`git branch --show-current` --delete --content-type "text/html"
```

## Destroying your site

When you have merged, or have otherwise fiinished with your feature branch, you will want to delete the deployed site. Simply run:

```shell
./terraform.sh destroy
```

## Troubleshooting

* __Access denied message when trying to reach CloudFront URL__
  * One common cause of this error message is not having uploaded your site yet.
  * Are you coming from a non-UK IP address, possbly due to a VPN being active? If so, switch this off and try again. Geographical restrictions are in place.
