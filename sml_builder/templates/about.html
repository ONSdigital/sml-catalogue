<h2>What is the Statistical Methods Library?</h2>
<p>A central library containing statistical methods for consistent reproducible statistical methods used within the Office for National Statistics (ONS)</p>
<h2>Future vision and missions:</h2>
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'Standardise best practice methods across government departments'
            },
            {
                "text": 'For the platform to be agnostic, so it may be used from anywhere and accessible across all digital platforms.'
            }
        ]
    })

<h2>Current objectives:</h2>
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
        
            {
                "text": 'To act as a shared single point of reference for best practice methods and share methods across government departments'
            },

                "text": 'To continuously update methods based on peer reviews, facts and user feedback'
            }
        ]
    })
}}
<h2>Further information:</h2>
<p>
A central library for approved statistical methods for use within the ONS and wider public sector. [OR (1) A central library for assured statistical methods for use within the ONS and wider public sector. (2) A central library for governed statistical methods for use within the ONS and wider public sector].
</p><p>
The library ensures that official statistical outputs are fully transparent. Such transparency provides proportionate governance and assurance processes, including statistical production and analysis/exploration through peer reviews. Additionally, continuous improvement is facilitated from such reviews and user feedback, i.e. method change requests and/or new method requests.
</p><p>
Through this library the ONS shares methods of best practice with other government departments. Providing comprehensive statistical method documentation, including but not limited to: (i) catalogue of methods; (ii) method codes and specifications; (iiii) how-to guidance; and (iv) contact details for help and support.
