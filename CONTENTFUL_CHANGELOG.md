description: Cell-key Perturbation adds small amounts of noise to frequency tables, to protect against disclosure. Noise is added to change the counts that appear in the frequency table by small amounts, for example a 14 is changed to a 15. This noise introduces uncertainty in the counts and makes it harder to identify individuals, especially when taking the ‘difference’ between two similar tables. An input file called a ‘ptable’ is needed which specifies the level of perturbation.

description: Ratio of means is a standard imputation method used for business surveys. The method imputes for each non-responding contributor a single numeric target variable within the dataset for multiple periods simultaneously. It uses the relationship between the target variable of interest and a predictive value and/or auxiliary variable to inform the imputed value. Due to its robust nature, it does not use any form of trimming or outliering.

As imputation can be carried out for multiple periods simultaneously, the method can apply forward, backward or construction imputation. The type of imputation used will vary for each non-respondent in each period depending on whether data is available in the predictive period.

description: Mean of Ratios imputation is a standard imputation method for business surveys. It can be used to impute value for unit (complete) non-response or item (partial) non-response. There is an option to use trimming as the method can be influenced by extreme values. The method imputes a single numeric variable. It uses the relationship between the variable being imputed and an appropriate predictive or auxiliary variable.

As imputation can be carried out for multiple periods simultaneously, the method can apply forward, backward or construction imputation. The type of imputation used will vary for each non-respondent in each period depending on whether data is available in the predictive period.

author: ONS
description: The automatic editing method for thousand pounds correction is commonly used across ONS business surveys. It is a generic rule that uses user defined thresholds to automatically detect and correct thousand pounds errors. This is when the respondent should have reported values in thousands of pounds but has reported in actual pounds e.g., returned a value of £56,000 instead of correctly submitting 56.

The method checks the ratio of a principal variable against a suitable predictor variable and make an automatic correction if the calculated ratio is around 1000. The automatic correction is applied to all relevant variables for the respondent.

description: Sampling in business surveys is often done using stratified simple random sampling without replacement. The largest businesses are usually selected with certainty. This SML method uses two approaches for estimating totals in such cases. The Horvitz-Thompson estimator in this case is known as a stratified expansion estimator, which is the simplest method used. We also use a combined ratio estimator. This is appropriate where there is a linear relationship through the origin between the target variable and an auxiliary variable we know for all units, and the scatter about the line increases with the size of the auxiliary variable.

about: # About the Statistical Methods Library

## What is the Statistical Methods Library?

The statistical methods library is a central library for approved statistical methods for use within ONS and wider.

## Overall mission

The Statistical Methods Library (SML) provides a central resource for consistent and reproducible statistical methods within the ONS and wider. The library ensures that methods for official statistical outputs are fully transparent. It provides proportionate governance and assurance processes, including peer review of methods for statistical production and analysis or exploration.

The library facilitates continuous improvement by providing users with the ability to add new methods or request changes to existing ones. It contains documentation on method specifications, how-to guidance and contact details for help and support. The SML will allow users to share methods and best practice with other government departments.

## Current objectives

- To act as a shared single point of reference for best practice methods and share methods across government departments.
- To continuously update methods based on peer reviews, emerging facts and user feedback.
- To provide clear evidence of audit and quality assurance for approved methods.

## Future objectives
- To standardise best practice methods across the ONS and government departments.
- To act as a developmental tool, providing reference material and guides to approved methods.
- To demonstrate, share and promote innovation in methodological practice across GSS/wider government.

## Further information
The SML contains many features, including:

- A catalogue of methods
- Statistical methods specifications
- A code repository
- Downloadable Methods packages
- Technical methods governance
- A glossary of terms
- How-to guidance

author: ONS
description: Cell-key Perturbation adds small amounts of noise to frequency tables, to protect against disclosure. Noise is added to change the counts that appear in the frequency table by small amounts, for example a 14 is changed to a 15. This noise introduces uncertainty in the counts and makes it harder to identify individuals, especially when taking the ‘difference’ between two similar tables. An input file called a ‘ptable’ is needed which specifies the level of perturbation.
