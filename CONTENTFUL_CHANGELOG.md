description: Cell-key Perturbation adds small amounts of noise to frequency tables, to protect against disclosure. Noise is added to change the counts that appear in the frequency table by small amounts, for example a 14 is changed to a 15. This noise introduces uncertainty in the counts and makes it harder to identify individuals, especially when taking the ‘difference’ between two similar tables. An input file called a ‘ptable’ is needed which specifies the level of perturbation.

description: Ratio of means is a standard imputation method used for business surveys. The method imputes for each non-responding contributor a single numeric target variable within the dataset for multiple periods simultaneously. It uses the relationship between the target variable of interest and a predictive value and/or auxiliary variable to inform the imputed value. Due to its robust nature, it does not use any form of trimming or outliering.

As imputation can be carried out for multiple periods simultaneously, the method can apply forward, backward or construction imputation. The type of imputation used will vary for each non-respondent in each period depending on whether data is available in the predictive period.

description: Mean of Ratios imputation is a standard imputation method for business surveys. It can be used to impute value for unit (complete) non-response or item (partial) non-response. There is an option to use trimming as the method can be influenced by extreme values. The method imputes a single numeric variable. It uses the relationship between the variable being imputed and an appropriate predictive or auxiliary variable.

As imputation can be carried out for multiple periods simultaneously, the method can apply forward, backward or construction imputation. The type of imputation used will vary for each non-respondent in each period depending on whether data is available in the predictive period.

author: ONS
description: The automatic editing method for thousand pounds correction is commonly used across ONS business surveys. It is a generic rule that uses user defined thresholds to automatically detect and correct thousand pounds errors. This is when the respondent should have reported values in thousands of pounds but has reported in actual pounds e.g., returned a value of £56,000 instead of correctly submitting 56.

The method checks the ratio of a principal variable against a suitable predictor variable and make an automatic correction if the calculated ratio is around 1000. The automatic correction is applied to all relevant variables for the respondent.

description: Sampling in business surveys is often done using stratified simple random sampling without replacement. The largest businesses are usually selected with certainty. This SML method uses two approaches for estimating totals in such cases. The Horvitz-Thompson estimator in this case is known as a stratified expansion estimator, which is the simplest method used. We also use a combined ratio estimator. This is appropriate where there is a linear relationship through the origin between the target variable and an auxiliary variable we know for all units, and the scatter about the line increases with the size of the auxiliary variable.

about: # About the Statistical Methods Library

## What is the Statistical Methods Library?

The statistical methods library is a central library for approved statistical methods for use within ONS and wider.

## Overall mission

The Statistical Methods Library (SML) provides a central resource for consistent and reproducible statistical methods within the ONS and wider. The library ensures that methods for official statistical outputs are fully transparent. It provides proportionate governance and assurance processes, including peer review of methods for statistical production and analysis or exploration.

The library facilitates continuous improvement by providing users with the ability to add new methods or request changes to existing ones. It contains documentation on method specifications, how-to guidance and contact details for help and support. The SML will allow users to share methods and best practice with other government departments.

## Current objectives

- To act as a shared single point of reference for best practice methods and share methods across government departments.
- To continuously update methods based on peer reviews, emerging facts and user feedback.
- To provide clear evidence of audit and quality assurance for approved methods.

## Future objectives
- To standardise best practice methods across the ONS and government departments.
- To act as a developmental tool, providing reference material and guides to approved methods.
- To demonstrate, share and promote innovation in methodological practice across GSS/wider government.

## Further information
The SML contains many features, including:

- A catalogue of methods
- Statistical methods specifications
- A code repository
- Downloadable Methods packages
- Technical methods governance
- A glossary of terms
- How-to guidance

description: Cell-key Perturbation adds small amounts of noise to frequency tables, to protect against disclosure. Noise is added to change the counts that appear in the frequency table by small amounts, for example a 14 is changed to a 15. This noise introduces uncertainty in the counts and makes it harder to identify individuals, especially when taking the ‘difference’ between two similar tables. An input file called a ‘ptable’ is needed which specifies the level of perturbation.

title: Install a method
content: # Install a method

### This page covers the following topics:
- How to install date adjustment, selective editing, thousand pounds, or totals and components
- How to install other Python methods
- How to install R methods
- Managing package dependencies with SML methods 

**Using a method:** 
Information on how to use individual methods can be found in the User Documentation. 

You can access the User Documentation from the Method Summary which you find by clicking on the method name in the Method Catalogue.

**Package dependencies:**
SML methods may require installation of specific versions of Python, R or essential packages. To avoid changing installations in your base environment, we recommend creating a virtual environment (Python) or using renv in an R Studio project. 

If you’d like further guidance on this, please see “Managing package dependencies with SML methods” below. 

## How to install date adjustment, selective editing, thousand pounds, or totals and components

Once you have set up the virtual environment and connected to your IDE (if using), follow the steps below.

1. Check you have installed the correct versions of Python and required packages such as Pandas (see User Documentation).

2.	From your Python environment enter `pip install sml_small`.

3.  To install a specific version enter `pip install sml_small==<version_number>`. For example, `pip install sml_small==1.1.0`. Search "sml_small" on “PyPI · The Python Package Index” for available versions.

4. To use Date Adjustment or Selective Editing run the following: `import sml_small.date_adjustment as date_adjust` or `import sml_small.selective_editing as seled`.  

5. To use Totals and Components or Thousand Pounds run the following: `from sml_small.editing import thousand_pounds` or `from sml_small.editing import totals_and_components`. 

The methods are now available for you to use.

## Installing other Python methods

Once you have set up the virtual environment and connected to an IDE (if using), follow the steps below. 

1.	Check you have installed the correct versions of Python and required packages such as Pandas (see User Documentation)

2.	From your Python environment enter `pip install <method_name>`. For example, the Python version of cell-key-perturbation is installed using `pip install cell_key_perturbation`.

3. To install a specific version enter `pip install <method_name>==<version_number>`. For example, `pip install cell_key_perturbation==1.1.1`. Search the method name on “PyPI · The Python Package Index” for available versions. 

The method is now available for you to import.

## Installing R methods

Once you have created an R Studio project using renv to install required packages, you are ready to download the method. For more guidance on using renv please see 'Managing package dependencies in R Studio with renv' below. 

1)	Install the method in your project using `renv::install("<method_name>")`. For example, if the method was named "aggregate" you would enter `renv::install("aggregate")`. 

2)  To install a specific version use `renv::install("package@version")`. For example, to install "aggregate 1.2.1" you would use `renv::install("aggregate@1.2.1")`. 

The method is now available for you to load. 

## Managing package dependencies with SML methods

This section covers the following topics:

- Managing package dependencies for Python methods using Conda
-	Connecting Spyder to a virtual environment
-	Connecting Jupyter Notebook to a virtual environment
-	Managing package dependencies in R Studio using renv

**Managing package dependencies for Python methods using Conda**

Virtual environments allow you to install specific versions of software in a contained environment. For example, you can install an older version of Python in a virtual environment but continue to use the most recent version of Python in your default environment. 

Please refer to the method User Documentation for information about which version of Python and packages like Pandas as Numpy you need to use for a specific method. You will need this information to correctly set up your environment. 

This guidance uses conda to create a virtual environment on your device. Conda is an open-source environment management system that allows you to create virtual environments.

1)	Search Anaconda Prompt on your device and click to open it (note, this will only work if you have already installed Anaconda or Miniconda).

2)	At the prompt enter `conda create <environment_name>`. You should name your environment something that will help you remember what it’s used for. If prompted, enter 'y' to proceed.

3)	Enter `conda activate <environment_name>`. 

You should now see your environment name to the left of the C:/ prompt. This shows you are working within the virtual environment. To leave the environment at any time enter `conda deactivate`. To come back to your environment later, simply repeat step 3.

5) Consult the User Documentation to identify what version of Python is required and to see what packages (and package versions) are needed. Make note of these.

4) Now, enter `conda install python=<version_number>`. If prompted, enter 'y' to proceed.

Note, Python versions > 3.4 automatically install pip, so that will likely be available to you in this environment after successfully installing Python. If not, enter `conda install pip`.

5)	Install required packages using `pip install <package_name>==<version>`. For example, `pip install pandas==1.5.3`. If you want to check what is currently installed in your environment enter `conda list`. 

If you would like to use the methods from within an IDE like Visual Studio, Spyder, or Jupyter Notebook, then you will need to install the kernels for these in the virtual environment and connect them to your session (see further guidance below)

Your virtual environment is now set up and ready for you to install your chosen SML method. Remember to deactivate your environment when you’re done setting it up by entering “conda deactivate” from the Anaconda prompt window.

The environment does not need to be activated here for you to use it with Spyder or Jupyter Notebook, providing you have followed the steps to connect the environment to these.

**Connecting Spyder to a virtual environment**

1)	Enter `pip install spyder-kernels` (still within Anaconda prompt and your virtual environment). If you have installed an older version of python (e.g., 3.7.1 for use with sml_small) then you need to specify an older version of spyder-kernels. To do this enter `pip install spyder-kernels=1.9.2`. 

2) Open Spyder.

3)	From the top menu, go to `Tools, Preferences, Python Interpreter`.

4)	Select `Use the following Python Interpreter`.

5)	Click on the `select file` icon (to the right of the address bar below).

6)	Navigate to the location of your virtual environment. 

If you’re unsure where this is, go to your Anaconda prompt window and enter `conda list` from within your virtual environment. The file path you need will appear at the top of the list.

7)	Click on the folder to open your virtual environment and scroll down to find and click on the python.exe file. 

8)	Click `Apply` and `OK` to close the Preferences window.

You should see your virtual environment name and the python version it’s running on the bottom of the Spyder window.

9) When you are done working from this environment, go back to steps 3-6 and select the Default interpreter, instead of your virtual environment.

**Connecting Jupyter Notebook to a virtual environment**

1)	Enter `pip install ipykernel` (still within Anaconda prompt and your virtual environment).

2)	Then enter `python -m ipykernel install --name <env_name>`. 

3)	Start Jupyter Notebook.

4)	From the `Files` page (you should be here by default) go to `New`, located in the top right.

5)	Click on `New` and select your virtual environment name.

6)	Your new notebook now will use the Python and package versions installed in this environment.

**Managing package dependencies in R Studio with renv**

1)	Open R Studio and select `File -> New Project`.

2)	Select `New Directory -> New Project` and give your directory a useful name.

3)	Tick `Use renv with this project`.

4)	Consult the User Documentation for details about what packages are required to run a method. Make note of these.

5)	Install required package versions using `renv::install("package@version")`.  For example, to install `devtools 2.4.4` use `renv::install("devtools@2.4.4")`. 

6)	Download and run the chosen SML method within this project environment (see "Installing R Methods" above for more guidance).

Using `renv` will make specified versions of packages available for this project, but will not affect versions installed outside the project. 

You can verify which versions are installed using `sessionInfo()`.

### This page covers the following topics:
- How to install date adjustment, selective editing, thousand pounds, or totals and components
- How to install other Python methods
- How to install R methods
- Managing package dependencies with SML methods 

**Using a method:** 
Information on how to use individual methods can be found in the User Documentation. 

You can access the User Documentation from the Method Summary which you find by clicking on the method name in the Method Catalogue.

**Package dependencies:**
SML methods may require installation of specific versions of Python, R or essential packages. To avoid changing installations in your base environment, we recommend creating a virtual environment (Python) or using renv in an R Studio project. 

If you’d like further guidance on this, please see “Managing package dependencies with SML methods” below. 

## How to install date adjustment, selective editing, thousand pounds, or totals and components

Once you have set up the virtual environment and connected to your IDE (if using), follow the steps below.

1. Check you have installed the correct versions of Python and required packages such as Pandas (see User Documentation).

2.	From your Python environment enter ```pip install sml_small```.

3.  To install a specific version enter ```pip install sml_small==version_number```. For example, ```pip install sml_small==1.1.0```. Search "sml_small" on “PyPI · The Python Package Index” for available versions.

4. To use Date Adjustment or Selective Editing run the following: ```import sml_small.date_adjustment as date_adjust``` or ```import sml_small.selective_editing as seled```.  

5. To use Totals and Components or Thousand Pounds run the following: ```from sml_small.editing import thousand_pounds``` or ```from sml_small.editing import totals_and_components```. 

The methods are now available for you to use.

## Installing other Python methods

Once you have set up the virtual environment and connected to an IDE (if using), follow the steps below. 

1.	Check you have installed the correct versions of Python and required packages such as Pandas (see User Documentation)

2.	From your Python environment enter ```pip install method_name```. For example, the Python version of cell-key-perturbation is installed using ```pip install cell_key_perturbation```.

3. To install a specific version enter ```pip install method_name==version_number```. For example, ```pip install cell_key_perturbation==1.1.1```. Search the method name on “PyPI · The Python Package Index” for available versions. 

The method is now available for you to import.

## Installing R methods

Once you have created an R Studio project using renv to install required packages, you are ready to download the method. For more guidance on using renv please see 'Managing package dependencies in R Studio with renv' below. 

1)	Install the method in your project using ```renv::install("method_name")```. For example, if the method was named "aggregate" you would enter ```renv::install("aggregate")```. 

2)  To install a specific version use ```renv::install("package@version")```. For example, to install "aggregate 1.2.1" you would use ```renv::install("aggregate@1.2.1")```. 

The method is now available for you to load. 

## Managing package dependencies with SML methods

This section covers the following topics:

- Managing package dependencies for Python methods using Conda
-	Connecting Spyder to a virtual environment

Note, Python versions > 3.4 automatically install pip, so that will likely be available to you in your environment after successfully installing Python. If not, enter __conda install pip__

5)	Install required packages using __pip install package_name==version__. 

For example, __pip install pandas==1.5.3__

If you want to check what is currently installed in your environment enter __conda list__ 

6)  If you would like to use the methods from within an IDE like Visual Studio, Spyder, or Jupyter Notebook, then you will need to install the kernels for these in the virtual environment and connect them to your session (see further guidance below)

Your virtual environment is now set up and ready for you to install your chosen SML method. Remember to deactivate your environment when you’re done setting it up by entering __conda deactivate__ from the Anaconda prompt window.

The environment does not need to be activated here for you to use it with Spyder or Jupyter Notebook, providing you have followed the steps to connect the environment to these.

**Connecting Spyder to a virtual environment**

1)	Enter __pip install spyder-kernels__ (still within Anaconda prompt and your virtual environment). If you have installed an older version of python (e.g., 3.7.1 for use with sml_small) then you need to specify an older version of spyder-kernels. 

To do this enter __pip install spyder-kernels=1.9.2__

2) Open Spyder.

3)	From the top menu, go to __Tools, Preferences, Python Interpreter__.

4)	Select __Use the following Python Interpreter__.

5)	Click on the __select file__ icon (to the right of the address bar below).

6)	Navigate to the location of your virtual environment. 

If you’re unsure where this is, go to your Anaconda prompt window and enter __conda list__ from within your virtual environment. The file path you need will appear at the top of the list.

7)	Click on the folder to open your virtual environment and scroll down to find and click on the __python.exe file__. 

8)	Click __Apply__ and __OK__ to close the Preferences window.

You should see your virtual environment name and the python version it’s running on the bottom of the Spyder window.

9) When you are done working from this environment, go back to steps 3-6 and select the Default interpreter, instead of your virtual environment.

**Connecting Jupyter Notebook to a virtual environment**

1)	Enter __pip install ipykernel__ (still within Anaconda prompt and your virtual environment).

2)	Then enter __python -m ipykernel install --name env_name__ 

3)	Start Jupyter Notebook.

4)	From the __Files__ page (you should be here by default) go to ```New```, located in the top right.

5)	Click on __New__ and select your virtual environment name.

6)	Your new notebook now will use the Python and package versions installed in this environment.

**Managing package dependencies in R Studio with renv**

1)	Open R Studio and select __File -> New Project__.

2)	Select __New Directory -> New Project__ and give your directory a useful name.

3)	Tick __Use renv with this project__.

4)	Consult the User Documentation for details about what packages are required to run a method. Make note of these.

5)	Install required package versions using __renv::install("package@version")__

For example, to install devtools 2.4.4 use __renv::install("devtools@2.4.4")__

6)	Download and run the chosen SML method within this project environment (see "Installing R Methods" above for more guidance).

Using renv will make specified versions of packages available for this project, but will not affect versions installed outside the project. 

You can verify which versions are installed using __sessionInfo()__
